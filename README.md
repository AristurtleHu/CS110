### 1.1

[code](https://github.com/AristurtleHu/RISC-V_to_MC_converter)

Implement a basic RISC-V assembler that converts assembly instructions into machine code. 

## HW

### hw2

Implement parsing of a modified floating-point format ca25 and conversion from the format to IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point number (fp32).

The C program keep performing the following tasks until EOF is met:

- Read a ca25 floating-point number which is expressed in 16-digit hex.
- Convert the loaded ca25 number to single-precision fp32.

For each ca25 number, the program produces three lines of output:

- Print the sign, exponent and significand of the original ca25.
- Print the sign, exponent and significand of the converted fp32.
- Print the hex representation of the converted fp32.
